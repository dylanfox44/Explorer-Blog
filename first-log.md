The void is quiet tonight. Or at least, as quiet as space ever gets. My ship, The Wayfarer, drifts through the shimmering strands of a distant nebula, its hull illuminated by the ghostly glow of ionized gases. I take a moment to simply watch, letting the colors shift and swirl beyond the reinforced glass of my viewport. I’ve seen thousands of these cosmic clouds, yet each one manages to steal my breath away. Out here, beauty and loneliness walk hand in hand.

It’s been 47 standard cycles since I last set foot on a habitable world. The last port of call was a floating colony orbiting a gas giant, its people hardened by the cold and the eternal storm churning below. I traded for supplies—rations, fuel, a few spare parts for the aging reactor core. They were kind enough to let me dock for the night, though the looks I got told me I was more an oddity than a guest. Sol-born humans are rare this deep into the spiral arm. We’re the remnants of a species that spread its wings but never quite learned how to fly together.

I left before sunrise. I always do. Long enough to remember what gravity feels like, short enough to avoid the questions. Where are you from? Where are you going? Why are you alone?

Truth be told, I don’t have an answer. I’ve spent years charting the unknown, recording data for whoever still listens. I tell myself that one day, my findings will reach someone—maybe even inspire another wanderer to follow in my footsteps. But the longer I drift, the less sure I am of that. Some days, it feels like I’m writing notes to a galaxy that doesn’t care.

But then there are moments like tonight. The nebula hums in silent symphony, its radiant tendrils stretching farther than my sensors can measure. I scan the surrounding space, picking up faint signals—distant pulses, echoes of civilizations long gone or yet to be discovered. One in particular stands out. A rhythmic transmission, artificial in nature, pulsing from the heart of a nearby asteroid belt.

Curiosity wins over caution. I adjust my course and engage the thrusters, my ship gliding toward the unknown. The signal grows stronger, forming patterns that tickle the back of my mind—familiar, yet elusive. It could be nothing. It could be everything. That’s the thrill of it, isn’t it? The not knowing.

"The void is quiet tonight. But maybe, just maybe, it has something to say."
