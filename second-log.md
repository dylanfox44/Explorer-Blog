# Log 002

I’ve spent the last twelve hours deciphering the signal. It pulses in steady intervals, carrying a complexity that suggests intent. A pattern, a message—perhaps even a greeting. But it’s old, ancient even. The decay in its transmission suggests it’s been bouncing through the asteroid belt for centuries, maybe millennia. Who sent it? And why?

I maneuver The Wayfarer closer to the source, weaving through drifting rock and ice. My sensors pinpoint a metallic structure embedded in one of the larger asteroids. A derelict station? A probe? Something else entirely? The signal originates from within.

Docking is out of the question. The structure’s too unstable, its surface riddled with the scars of time and impact. Instead, I send a drone. Its tiny frame drifts toward the anomaly, relaying visuals to my console. The screen flickers, then resolves into a haunting image—a doorway, half-buried in rock and debris. Etched into the metal above it are symbols I don’t recognize, yet something about them feels... familiar.

I take a deep breath. My hand hovers over the controls. Do I dig deeper? Do I risk waking whatever lies within? The void has spoken, and now it waits for my reply.

I end the log with a single thought:

"Some doors, once opened, can never be closed again."
